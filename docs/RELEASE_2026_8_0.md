# 2026.8.0: Native HA Video Phones, Multi-Room Calling And PBX Routing

<!-- Canonical source for the v2026.8.0 GitHub release body. -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Read the [Breaking Changes](https://github.com/n-IA-hane/esphome-intercom/blob/v2026.8.0/docs/BREAKING_CHANGES.md)

`2026.8.0` is the release where VoIP Stack stops looking like one clever
intercom and starts behaving like a small, Home Assistant-native communications
system. ESP devices, browser phones, wall tablets, standard SIP accounts,
Assist, ring groups, conference rooms and an optional provider trunk now share
one local roster and one standards-based SIP/SDP/RTP call model.

This note contains only the user-visible delta since stable `2026.7.1`.

## 🏠 One Home Assistant, Every Phone

Home Assistant can now host multiple logical browser phones. Keep the migrated
default phone, then add Kitchen, Reception, Office or any other room from
**Settings > Devices & services > VoIP Stack > Add phone**. Bind one
`ha_softphone` card and one real browser/tablet session to each Device.

- Every HA phone has its own name, extension, DND, availability, groups, video
  capability and call state.
- Browser phones and registered SIP accounts are native integration Devices
  with scoped state, connectivity, controls and call Event Entities.
- ESP phones remain their existing ESPHome Devices. VoIP Stack discovers and
  routes them without creating duplicates.
- Logical phones share the same SIP listeners and dynamic RTP pool; they do not
  reserve one server port set per room.
- Two browser phones can call each other locally with independent audio and
  video. External legs remain normal SIP/SDP/RTP.
- One endpoint owns one call. A second caller receives `486 Busy Here`, while
  calls to other phones continue independently.
- A logical phone may keep ringing while its kiosk browser is offline, allowing
  missed-call, timeout and fallback automations to remain meaningful.

## 🎥 SIP Video Calling

The HA softphone can now become an opt-in SIP video phone for standard phones,
softphones, PBXs and video door stations. ESPHome endpoints intentionally remain
audio-only.

- Direct receive supports H.264, VP8 and RTP/JPEG without decoding or
  re-encoding video on the HA server.
- Compatible H.264 and VP8 calls can send the browser camera when both the
  integration-wide permission and that phone's persistent **Send Camera**
  switch are on. **Auto Answer** and **Send Camera** are phone settings stored
  by the integration, so clearing browser cache does not reset them; microphone
  and camera permission remains local to the browser that owns the call media.
- Optional bounded FFmpeg receive converts H.263, H.263-1998 or H.265 to VP8.
  It is receive-only, single-slot and never records an intermediate file.
- Incoming and outgoing calls support `sendrecv`, `sendonly`, `recvonly` and
  `inactive` directions.
- Direct calls and video-capable trunk/PBX routes use the same media contract.
  Authenticated retries preserve the complete audio/video offer.
- A direct HA-browser dialog can accept compatible peer-initiated video
  add/remove, hold/resume and RTP endpoint changes through re-INVITE or UPDATE.
- RTP/AVP remains the compatible default. Negotiated AVPF adds compound RTCP
  reports and bounded PLI/FIR key-frame recovery.
- Camera denial, decoder failure, unsupported video or optional transcoder
  failure does not tear down compatible audio.
- The card keeps video inside its configured Lovelace geometry, preserves the
  native aspect ratio and moves identity, duration and Hang Up into a compact
  translucent bottom bar.
- Detailed media counters appear only with backend debug and **Extended
  information** enabled.

Video remains opt-in and requires HTTPS, a compatible browser and an RTP path
permitted by the local firewall. Read

## 🧭 Initial Preview: Automation-Native PBX Routing

Home Assistant automations can now influence an inbound call at explicit
decision points instead of replacing the normal dial plan.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a preliminary, disabled-by-default API. Event fields, decision
> timing and service semantics may change in a future release while more real
> PBX installations shape the final contract. The central phonebook, explicit
> extensions and configured fallback destination remain the stable default.

- Direct inbound mode can expose a short `route_requested` decision before the
  configured target.
- DTMF mode gives explicit extension digits priority and exposes automation
  routing only when no digits were entered.
- `ingress` and `origin` distinguish provider/PBX trunk calls from local
  extension calls without relying on internal ownership fields.
- `voip_stack.select_inbound_destination` selects the initial target.
- `voip_stack.forward` moves an already ringing or connected HA-owned call to
  another phone, ESP, registered endpoint, group or Assist pipeline.
- Forward failures can `resume`, terminate or return busy; a replaced ringing
  SIP leg receives a real CANCEL.
- Per-phone state Sensor and call Event Entities support native HA triggers
  such as `ringing for 30 seconds`, without helper timers or Call-ID templates
  for the ordinary single-call case.
- Once Assist owns the call, compatible in-dialog audio updates remain live;
  video re-offers are answered explicitly with `m=video 0` because the Assist
  endpoint is audio-only, rather than interrupting TTS or stranding the dialog.
- Revision and sequence guards remain available for concurrent or multi-stage
  routing policies.

</p>

Yes: an unanswered door station can now be forwarded to Assist. What Assist
says is controlled by your pipeline prompt. Good judgement is still not
included.

Copyable native-UI automation examples are in
[Automation Dial Plan](https://github.com/n-IA-hane/esphome-intercom/blob/v2026.8.0/docs/AUTOMATION_DIALPLAN.md).

## 👥 Ring Groups And Conference Groups

Groups now re-enter the same canonical PBX dispatcher as every other target.
They are no longer special routing shortcuts with subtly different media or
ownership rules.

- A ring group calls all eligible members in parallel.
- The first answer wins; losing early dialogs receive CANCEL and a confirmed
  losing dialog receives BYE.
- The originating endpoint is excluded when it is also a group member.
- DND, disabled endpoints, busy state and endpoint capability are applied
  before fan-out.
- Browser phones, ESP endpoints and registered SIP accounts can share one
  group without forcing audio-only members to negotiate video.
- A conference group is a real HA-hosted focus: members join the same mixed
  room, optional invitees ring, and the room closes when the last participant
  leaves.

## ☎️ A More Predictable SIP/PBX Core

Most of this release is invisible when it works, which is precisely the point.
The former monolithic runtime has been decomposed around explicit call,
transaction, dialog, route and media ownership primitives.

- A logical call owns its generation, legs, tasks, media reservations and one
  cancellation-safe cleanup barrier.
- SIP dialogs follow Call-ID and tags, not the lifetime or source port of one
  TCP connection. Established trunk calls survive a replacement flow.
- Inbound answer is transactional: prepare resources, send the final response,
  commit media or roll everything back.
- Audio and video media updates commit atomically against the current call
  generation. A late re-INVITE cannot leave the two directions on different
  revisions.
- State transitions are monotonic. Late provisional responses or stale browser
  callbacks cannot resurrect a terminated card.
- Hang Up remains available through calling, connecting and remote ringing.
  SIP CANCEL, `487 Request Terminated`, ACK and crossed-`200` BYE handling now
  share one lifecycle.
- Remote Contact and Record-Route state are retained for correct in-dialog ACK,
  BYE, INFO, UPDATE and re-INVITE routing through proxies.
- Cleanup is idempotent and releases dialogs, tasks, media owners, relays, RTP
  reservations and optional transcoder slots before the endpoint returns idle.

## 🔢 DTMF, Registered Phones And Trunks

- Initial trunk extension selection supports negotiated RFC 4733
  `telephone-event` and compatible SIP INFO digits.
- Established HA-owned bridges publish one experimental `voip_stack.dtmf`
  occurrence per RFC 4733 or SIP INFO key for door/gate automations.
- Direct ESP-to-ESP media remains outside HA and therefore does not generate
  backend DTMF events.
- Registered standard SIP accounts appear in the phonebook only while a live
  registrar Contact exists.
- Outbound trunk calls use the configured address-of-record identity while
  keeping an independent digest-auth username.
- Authenticated retries preserve Request-URI, Call-ID and SDP while incrementing
  CSeq and using a fresh Via branch.

## 🎙️ One Audio Device, Every Voice Feature

Maintained full-device profiles keep music, TTS, wake word, Voice Assistant and
VoIP on one coordinated ESPHome audio system. Playback feeds one controlled
output and one phase-coherent AEC/AFE reference; Micro Wake Word, Voice
Assistant and VoIP TX consume the same cleaned post-AEC microphone.

<p align="center">

    alt="Shared audio output and clean post-AEC microphone pipeline"
    width="1000"
  />
</p>

ESPHome's primary platform rules are now explicit: the core no longer
auto-loads button, number, switch, text or text-sensor platforms. Maintained
YAMLs include the wanted native entities explicitly; minimal VoIP targets no
longer need empty platform blocks.

## 🖥️ Card, Diagnostics And Documentation

- Normal call actions now use one vocabulary: `destination` selects what to
  call and the optional `device_id` selects which phone acts. Development-only
  destination aliases, selector aliases and the private start WebSocket path
  were removed before stable release instead of becoming parallel APIs.
- Browser-phone Devices expose native Extension, Ring groups, Conference
  groups, Ring for conference calls and DND controls. Device entities, card
  settings and actions all update the same persisted phone configuration.
- Card commands use normal Home Assistant services and authoritative response
  snapshots; the frontend does not invent call IDs or a parallel state machine.
- Phone identity, presentation and browser audio/video negotiation now live in
  focused models instead of one giant card file.
- Repeated HA state changes no longer rebuild unchanged phonebook and
  destination DOM during call setup.
- Browser media handoff is scoped by phone, call and direction, so reloading one
  dashboard cannot block or steal another phone's microphone/camera.
- Navigating between dashboards or closing a completed call releases browser
  media claims without leaving another phone disabled or showing a false
  "media active in another tab" error.
- Config-entry and per-device diagnostics can be downloaded through Home
  Assistant with credentials, addresses and other private values redacted.
- The Home Assistant card picker suggests the VoIP Stack card directly from a
  browser-phone call-state entity and binds the resulting card to the correct
  phone Device.
- Logbook records one readable summary per PBX session instead of exposing a
  stream of internal leg transitions.
- Runtime snapshots expose sessions, legs, routes, SIP clients, relays, audio
  and video WebSockets, owners, cleanup tasks and allocated RTP ports.
- The README now uses a consistent illustrated visual language for system
  topology, signaling transport, phonebook routing and canonical call paths;
  the service, trunk, automation, video, testing and troubleshooting guides
  describe the same behavior.

## ⚠️ Compatibility And Deliberate Limits

The `2026.7.0` SIP migration remains the breaking baseline. For `2026.8.0`:

- custom ESP YAMLs that relied on `auto_entities` must declare the desired
  native `platform: voip_stack` entities or include the maintained package;
- experimental automation routing is opt-in and may evolve;
- Home Assistant terminates video media in its browser softphone, but the
  remote peer can be a standard SIP video phone, video door station, softphone
  or a compatible endpoint reached through a PBX/trunk. ESP and Assist
  endpoints remain audio-only, conference video mixing is not implemented,
  and SIP-to-SIP video bridges require an exact compatible codec/profile;
- local SIP/RTP is plaintext. Use a trusted LAN/VLAN/VPN and do not expose ESP
  listeners directly to the Internet;
- there is no SRTP, SIP/TLS on ESP, ICE/STUN/TURN, recording or general-purpose
  video transcoding PBX.

See the
[Breaking Changes](https://github.com/n-IA-hane/esphome-intercom/blob/v2026.8.0/docs/BREAKING_CHANGES.md)
and the individual feature guides before updating a custom deployment.

## 🧪 Qualification

The release passes **1102 tests plus 99 subtests**, together with Ruff and
JavaScript parsing. Real calls cover browser phones, ESP endpoints, registered
SIP accounts, groups, conferences, trunks, audio, bidirectional video and
post-call cleanup.

## 📦 Installing Or Upgrading

1. Back up the existing integration and configuration.
2. Install or update VoIP Stack through HACS. Manual installations can download
   `voip_stack.zip` from the `v2026.8.0` GitHub release.
3. Extract it into `config/custom_components/voip_stack/`, replacing the
   previous component directory only when installing manually.
4. Restart Home Assistant.
5. Hard-refresh every dashboard and fully restart the Android Companion app so
   the card version matches the backend.
6. Reopen VoIP Stack options to enable SIP video or automation
   routing; both remain off by default.

Please report the exact call path, SIP transport, offer/answer SDP, endpoint
states and final cleanup snapshot when something misbehaves. “It broke” is
emotionally valid but slightly less useful to a SIP transaction.
